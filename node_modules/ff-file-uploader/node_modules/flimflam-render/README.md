# flimflam-render

Render a [Flimflam](http://flimflamjs.github.io) UI component onto the page (and keep rendering/patching it on every stream update).

This module is included in the core `flimflam` package, and you can require it `require('flimflam/render')`.

## render(view, state, container)

This function is all you need to render your top-level UI component to the page. It only needs to be called once for a whole one-page app using the top-most view and state.

* `view`: the top-level view function that takes the state as a parameter and returns a vnode tree
* `state`: an object containing values, flyd streams, and nested objects for use in the view
* `container`: a regular DOM Node that you want to replace with the markup generated by your view function


__Usage__

```js
const render = require('flimflam/render')

// import your app's parent component and view function...
const component = require('./my-component')

const view = component.view
const state = component.init()
const container = document.body
render(view, state, container)
```

### development

Tests use tape and tape-run, and can be executed with: `npm run test`

The main index.js file is plain ES5, while the test file uses browserify with es2040.
