Critics have described the album as having two specific themes: celebration of Europe and the disparities between reality and image. Musically, the songs on this album differ from the group's earlier Krautrock style with a focus on electronic mechanized rhythms, minimalism, and occasional manipulated vocals.","tracks":["Europe Endless","The Hall of Mirrors","Showroom Dummies","Trans-Europe Express","Metal on Metal","Franz Schubert","Endless Endless"],"personnel":[{"name":"Ralf Hütter","instruments":["voice","electronics","synthesizer","orchestron","synthanorma-sequenzer"]},{"name":"Florian Schneider","instruments":["voice","vocoder","votrax","electronics","synthesizer"]},{"name":"Karl Bartos","instruments":["electronic percussion"]},{"name":"Wolfgang Flür","instruments":["electronic percussion"]}]},{"id":7,"name":"The Man-Machine","year":1978,"img":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7f/Kraftwerk_-_The_Man-Machine.png/220px-Kraftwerk_-_The_Man-Machine.png","length":36.1,"label":["Kling Klang","EMI","Capitol"],"blurb":"The Man-Machine (German: Die Mensch-Maschine) is the seventh studio album by German electronic music band Kraftwerk, released in May 1978.
